AI SearchTerminology
Agent - an entity that perceives its environment and acts upon that environmentState - the situation in which the agent finds itselfActions - choices that can be made in a state    ACTIONS(s) - returns the set of actions that can be executed in state sTransition Model - a description of what state results from performing any applicable action in any state    RESULT(s,a)  - returns the state resulting from performing action a in state sState Space - the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actionsGoal Test - a way to determine whether a given state is a goal statePath Cost - numerical cost associated with a given pathSolution - a sequence of actions that leads from an initial state to the goal stateSearch ProblemsThey have...
	* Initial State
	* Actions
	* Transition Model
	* Goal Test
	* Path Cost Function

Data RepresentationNode - a data structure that keeps track of:
	* a state
	* a parent
	* an action (to get from parent to node)
	* a path cost (to get from initial state to node)

Frontier - a data structure which contains all nodes which could be reached from the current node, represents all things which could be explored, which have not yet been exploredApproach
	* Start with a frontier that contains the initial state
	* Loop:

		* If the frontier is empty, there is no solution
		* Remove a node from the frontier
		* If node contains goal state, return the solution
		* Expand the node, add resulting nodes to the frontier

Revised Approach
	* Start with a frontier that contains the initial state and an empty explored set
	* Loop:

		* If the frontier is empty, there is no solution
		* Remove a node from the frontier
		* If node contains goal state, return the solution
		* Add the node to the explored dtate
		* Expand the node, add resulting nodes to the frontier if they aren't already in the frontier or the explored set

Depth-First SearchSearch algorithms that always expand the deepest node in the frontierBreadth-First SearchSearch algorithm that always expands the shallowest node in the frontier    Queue - first-in first-out data typeUninformed SearchSearch strategy that uses no problem-specific knowledgeInformed SearchSearch strategy that uses problem-specific knowledgeGreedy Best-First SearchSearch algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, as estimated by a heuristic function h(n)A* Search
Search algorithm that expands node with lowest value of g(n) + h(n)
    g(n) = cost to reach node
    h(n) = estimate cost to goal
Optimal under certain conditions
    h(n) does not overestimate the true cost
    h(n) is consistent 

Minimax
To help AI play games, values need to be assigned to wins and losses and given the goal state of minimizing or maximizing values
AI calculate the value of moves recursively by looking ahead to the max value of future states possible if a move is made, they anticipate opponent moves and their own future moves
The ensuing logic becomes. the MAX value player will take the action that produces the highest value of the minimum value of future states, the minimizing player does the opposite

Alpha-Beta Pruning
In an AI search tree, in a value maximization problem, if a branch is found to contain a node of lower value, the rest of the branch does not need to be explored

Depth-Limited Minimax
A min-maxing function will only evaluate a certain  depth of states

Evaluation Function
Functions that estimate the expected utility of the game from a given state without recursively considering future states
