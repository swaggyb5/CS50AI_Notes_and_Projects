Project 1 for CS50AI had two exercises.

The first was designing an algorithm to find the 'degrees of separation' between two film actors (a la Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon).
  For this project, you were provided helper functions in the util.py file and given instructions on how to edit the degrees.py function.

The second was designing an algorithm for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
